        <p>The big idea for this lab was to work with our partner and
           experiment with the many CSS selectors.</p>

        <p class="result">For this lab I ran into a few problems. Some of
           problems I ran into was figuring out how to shorten the outline for
           my h2 elements. Another problem I ran into was figuring out how
           to make the image change in size when hovering over it.
           <br>
           Last, but not least, I was having a bit of trouble with styling a
           particular type of element that has a class name. When I tried doing
           it with an h2 element, nothing showed up when I viewed it in browser.
           I tried it with a paragraph element and it worked for that one, I was
           not sure what I was doing wrong. Something I did was do some of the
           styling in code pen to see how it would look like. For the rest, I
           inspected my server to see what I was doing wrong and did some tweaks
           on there.</p>

          <br>
          You would be able to see all the different styles on this page. That
          means all the tags were used properly. The 'Back to Home' button
          should be accessible and the page should look colurful and not all
          blank.</p>
