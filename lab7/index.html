        <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>The big idea for this lab was to work with our partner and create
           our lab7 index. Giving it some style to it while using CSS.</p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>For this lab I didn't run into any problems. I was just playing
           around with CSS, seeing what I was capable of doing. Everything
           was pretty easy to grasp on and apply it to this lab. </p>

           If your seeing this browser correctly, then that means everything
           went according to plan. All the tags are used correctly and the
           "Back Home" button is accecible. The page should also be decorated
           and not just a blank page, meaning that my CSS file is linked
           properly. ^-^ </p>
