          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>The big idea for this lab was to work with our partners. Creating
             a new folder for our lab 10 assignment and adding proper files
             within it. Being able to style our text elements, making the
             heading stand out from the rest.</p>

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this lab, I didn't run into any problems. Everything was pretty
             easy and straightforward.</p>

            Different text styles should show up on the server. The title is a
            different style than the paragraphs and headings. I gave the
            paragraphs more of a handwriting style. While for the 'Back to Home'
            text, it has more of an outline than a single stroke. =^_^= </p>
