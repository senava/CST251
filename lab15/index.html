          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Lab 15 (o.o)/
            <br>
            The big idea for this lab was to work with our partner, trying to
            experiment with CSS and style our page in a more complex way.
            Experimenting with fancy CSS styles, adding shadows to different
            elements, filters and etc. (^-^)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="problem">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this lab I didn't really ran into any problems. I actually
             have been using these styling elements for quite a while. I
             already had an idea on how to use gradients, filters, and rounded
             corners. The only new information I gained were text/box
             shadow, object-fit, and transform. But even those weren't to
             difficult to incorporate into my server. *(^o^)*</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="result">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>If you are able to read this, then that means I was able to
             successfully add everything onto my server and not just have it be
             a blank page. When you first reach my server, at the top you
             should be able to see a slight text shadow for my links, those
             being the CSS file for this lab and the 'Back to Home Page'.
             At the top center my title should have a border surrounding it,
             having curved corners instead of it all being a box. The same
             goes for my main content, the corners are a bit curved, but not
             so much. At the bottom of this paragraph you should be able to
             see two images...</p>

               <div class="star">
                 <img src="img/star.jpg" alt="star">
                 <img src="img/galaxy.jpg" alt="galaxy">
               </div>

             <p>These images both have object-fit, which makes them the same
             size, having only those that fit into the box be shown.
             <br>
             At the very bottom of my page, I added 4 images, styled as
             polaroids. When you first see them they appear all black and white,
             having a slight blur to them and being tilted at a certain degree.
             I was able to create this effect by using filters and transform.
             Once you hover over them, the color will start to appear, having
             a slight change in hue within them. Last but not least, the
             GRADIENT EFFECT. This could be seen at the top of my page where my
             links are, as well as my main content. Overall this was a pretty
             easy lab and so much fun to mess around with. (n-n)</p>
