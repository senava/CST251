          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Lab 13 (o.o)/
            <br>
            The big idea for this lab was to work with our partner. Being able
            to use block-leveling and typorgraphy css to recreate a webpage of
            our chosing. Figuring out how to find the fonts used on that site
            and use it on our recreated website. (^-^)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="problem">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p> I did not really had as much difficulties for recreating the site.
              It was a bit time consuming, trying to get everything in the
              corresponding places and having the right fonts. One of the
              challenges I did ran into was trying to figure out how to import
              the fonts I put into "Find my font" to my html. I did not really
              have an idea on how to do it, but I was lucky enough to find
              similar fonts in Google Fonts which matched the original. *(^o^)*</p>

        <section class="minor-section" id="result">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Here are my results, everything was able to tranfer to the server
             nicely. Having both the original and fake site show up and
             have the ability to resize the frames within the server. (n-n)</p>
