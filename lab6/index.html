		<h1>Lab 6: More Complicated HTML</h1>
		<p>The big idea for this lab is to create an html file and then style it
			 with a CSS file.</p>

		<img src="img/castle-full.png" id="castle" width=300>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>I had no difficulties for this lab. I was just overwhelmed with all of
			 the information that was being given. It was a lot to take in but once
		 	 doing it one step at a time, I was able to understand everything clearly.
		</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>The results for this lab is this browser you are currently looking at.
			 I liked the way I was able to make this page look different from the
		 	 rest. Not having it all just with a blank background. By having the
		 	 background look a bit different I had to link my CSS file.</p>
