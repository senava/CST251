		<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
		<div class="content">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab was to create a webpage with images and links
				 to other pages.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Some of the problems I encountered in this lab was figuring out how to
				 add links to my document. Figuring out the correct tag that can make my
			 	 link go to an external page.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>To solve this challenge I revisited freeCodeCamp.org to see what type
				 of tag is needed for adding links to my browser. By revisting this site,
			 	 I was able to figure out how to add a link that will go to an external
			 	 page. As well as being able to link one of my images to another site.</p>
