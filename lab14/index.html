          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Lab 14 (o.o)/
            <br>
            The big idea for this lab is similar to the last lab. We had to
            work with our partner and try to recreate a typography site of our
            chosing. Being able to use block-leveling and typorgraphy css to
            recreate the webpage, to the best of our ability. This time we had
            to try and recreate a more complicated webpage. (^-^)</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="problem">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p> I took about 2 whole days to try and recreate this webpage, so I
              did ran into quite a few problems trying to do so. Something I
              had a difficult time trying ot recreate were the images inside of
              the numbers, with the gradient effect and having it not move from
              its position, when resizing the page. To figure this problem out
              I inspected my browser, seeing what I could do to apply this
              effect and not have the images change when resizing the page. I
              spent time going back and forward, seeing what worked and what
              didn't. I was finally able to figure out how to apply the effect,
              by having each individual image have a specific background size and
              a background clip. This gave me the effect of the images being
              inside of the numbers and when resizing it, they wont move at all.
              Another problem I ran into was figuring out how have the little
              triangle in the menu appear centered. I tried everything and
              it didn't seem to budge from its area. Unfortunately I was not able
              to figure out how to make the triangle appear centered, but
              hopefully, with more practice, I could get it looking exactly
              like the original. *(^o^)*</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="result">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>Here are my results, everything was able to tranfer to the server
             nicely. Having both the original and fake site show up and
             have the ability to resize the frames within the server.
             <br>
             As you can see underneath here, I have both images: the original
             site and my recreation of it. I tried my best to recreate the
             webpage to the best of my ability, and I think it came out pretty
             good. There are some mistakes here and there, but overall I think
             you can get the image of it. I added a link to both my recreation's
             CSS spreadsheet and the site, that way you are able to see my
             recreation for yourself, on its own site. (n-n)</p>
