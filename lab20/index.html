          <h2>Challenge For Today</h2>
          <p>Todays big idea for Lab 20 is something to do with our Final Project.
             <br>For this lab, all we had to do was to work individually.
             We had to put our creativity to test and do a few sketches,
             creating a series of prototype designs for our teams project site.</p>

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this lab, I didn't really ran into any problems. The only
             difficult part I ran into was figuring out how to start off with my
             sketches. Trying to sketch 15 different ideas was pretty difficult,
             but at the end of the day, I was able to come up with a few
             different ideas. Keep in mind, these are just quick sketches which
             can help my teammates get an idea of my take in how the site can
             look like.</p>
