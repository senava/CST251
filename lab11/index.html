          <p>Hai... Hello o/.
            <br>
             I hope you are having an amazing day today. =^-^=
            <br>
             This is Lab 11, and today's challenge was to work together with
             our partner, and experiment with different block level styling.
             First we need to create a new folder to keep everything nice and
             tidy. Containing all of our files, folders, stylesheets, and images.
             Then we can style everything in our CSS stylesheet. Adding block
             elements and styling them to our preference.</p>

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this lab I had a few problems. One of the problem I had was
             trying to get my sidebar div to be positioned to the right of
             the rest of the content, without using the float element. I used
             the inline-block style to get it to be on the same line as the
             other contents, but the thing I was struggling with is getting my
             sidebar div to stay to the right, but at a further distant, without
             having to change the width of the other content. That was the only
             thing I had difficulties with. I tended to keep on using the
             float style, it became a habit of mine, in adding the style to my
             images and other elements, so it was pretty hard to not use it.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="result" class="minor-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> As a result, you should be able to see my sidebar div on the right
              of my main elements. By using the inline-block style for the
              sidebar div, it was able to appear to the right of an element,
              without having to use the float style in CSS. You should also
              be able to see my link at the bottom of the server, without
              moving with the whole entire page.</p>
