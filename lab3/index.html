	<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab was to further create a local file on my
	   computer and be able to add index.html files. As well as adding images to
	   our files.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>Some of the challenges I had was figuring out how to add images to my
	   files. As well as figuring out the correct tags to use. Another
 	   difficulty I had was finding out how to make the files work correctly.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The results from this lab was really interesting. Firstly, you are
	   able to see this index.html file pretty well. Here is the file structure in
 	   which I have made:</p>

	<p>Another thing you are able to see is me figuring out which tags to use, in
		 the correct way. Here is my html source code, showing the different tags I
	   used to create my file:</p>

	<p>After figuring out which tags to use, and knowing what they are for, you
  	 are able to see my work on the browser. Here is my work popping up on a
   	 browser:</p>
