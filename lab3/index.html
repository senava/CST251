		<div class="content">
			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The subject of this lab was to further create a local file on my
			   computer and be able to add index.html files. As well as adding images to
			   our files.</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Some of the challenges I had was figuring out how to add images to my
			   files. As well as figuring out the correct tags to use. Another
		 	   difficulty I had was finding out how to make the files work correctly.</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>The results from this lab was really interesting. Firstly, you are
			   able to see this index.html file pretty well. Here is the file structure in
		 	   which I have made:</p>
			<img src="img/file_structure.png" width=350>

			<p>Another thing you are able to see is me figuring out which tags to use, in
				 the correct way. Here is my html source code, showing the different tags I
			   used to create my file:</p>
			<img src="img/html-source-code.png" width=350>

			<p>After figuring out which tags to use, and knowing what they are for, you
		  	 are able to see my work on the browser. Here is my work popping up on a
		   	 browser:</p>
