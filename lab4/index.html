	<h1>Lab 4: File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The subject of this lab was to test our local files and then upload them
	to our server.</p>

	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I did not really have any challenges for this lab. Everything seemed
	pretty easy and straight forward. Most of the tasks we had to do were
	something I have seen before, so I knew what had to be done.</p>

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>The results from this lab show that you are able to see all of the content
	perfectly good. All the words are showing up, as well as the images. Being
	able to see this on your browser is also a result of eveything being
	typed out, correctly, on Atom and being further pushed on GitHub.</p>
	<p>Following is an image of the index.html, for this lab, on Atom:</p>
