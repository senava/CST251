          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>This is Lab 12, today's challenge is kinda similar to last lab,
             but we are getting a bit more practice with styling our
             block-levels. The idea of this lab was to work with our partners
             and experiment more with block level styling. That being said, we
             need to center some of our contents. (^-^)</p>

        <section class="minor-section" id="problem">
          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this lab, I did not really run into any problems at all.
             Everything was pretty straightforward and easy to follow
             along. All I had to do was just go back into my CSS and just
             adjust some of the numbers, that way I can get the look I was
             picturing in my mind. *(^o^)*</p>
        </section>
        <section class="minor-section" id="result">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>As a result, you should be able to see all of my divs with a width
             of 30%, as well as one of my elements floating to the right. (That
             being the "This is a sample text one") You are also able to see one
             of my elements with centered text. Another thing that should show
             up are my images, one of them being centered horizontally, while
             the other is centered both horizontally and vertically. Last but
             not least, the 'Back to Home Page' should be working, when clicking
             on it, it should take you back to my home page. (n-n)</p>

      <div id="floated">
        <p>This is another sample text. I don't really know what else to write
           in here, but we will see. I might come back later and fill this
           place with some other type of writting, who knows. For know I will
           leave you with this face. Cya o/

      <div id="center-horz">
        <p>This is a sample text. I will ad more content to this area in a bit.
         Just something to keep the area looking like it has something
         inside of it. BRB
