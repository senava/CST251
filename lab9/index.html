          <p>The big idea for this lab was to work with our partners
             in being able to style block elements. Making them
             stand out from the others.</p>

          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>So far for this lab I have not had any difficulties. I am still
             going through the different tasks, currently on Task 1. I am
             still adding things to my html.... I will get back to you soon
             if I do run into any problems. ^-^

             <b>UPDATE!!!</b>
             <br>
             I did run into a few problems this lab. The only problem I had was
             getting my background be an image. For some reason it was not
             responding, after I had checked everything multiple of times. I
             messaged my partner if she had any difficulties but everything
             seemed to be working on her side. She sent me the CSS selector she
             used, so I gave it a try. It wasn't working for a few but I
             realised that my spelling wasn't the same. After I spelt it
             correctly everything seemed to be working perfectly fine. That was
             all I had trouble with. I did use w3schools to get some ideas on
             what I can style and how, but that was all. \(^_^)/</p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>If everything went to plan...
            <br>
            Everything should have showed up on the server. Having all the
            headings and borders the correct style. All images should show
            up and be styles. The 'Back to Home Page' anchor should take you
            back to the Home Page. =^_^= </p>
